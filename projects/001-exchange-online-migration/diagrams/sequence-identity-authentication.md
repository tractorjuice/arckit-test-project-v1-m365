```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OutlookClient as Outlook Client (OWA/Desktop/Mobile)
    participant AzureAD as Azure AD (Entra ID)
    participant ConditionalAccess as Conditional Access Engine
    participant Intune
    participant MFAService as MFA Service (Microsoft Authenticator)
    participant ExchangeOnline as Exchange Online
    participant AuditLog as Unified Audit Log

    User->>OutlookClient: Enter credentials (user@cabinetoffice.gov.uk)
    OutlookClient->>AzureAD: POST /oauth2/v2.0/token<br/>{username, password}

    AzureAD->>AzureAD: Validate password hash (PHS from on-prem AD)

    alt Invalid credentials
        AzureAD-->>OutlookClient: 401 Unauthorized
        OutlookClient-->>User: Invalid username or password
        AzureAD->>AuditLog: Log failed sign-in attempt
    end

    AzureAD->>ConditionalAccess: Evaluate policies (5 policies: MFA, device, location, legacy auth, risk)

        AzureAD->>AuditLog: Log blocked non-compliant device
    end

    Intune-->>ConditionalAccess: Device compliant

    ConditionalAccess->>ConditionalAccess: Policy 4: Check location (UK geofencing)

    alt Non-UK IP address (not on approved traveler list)
        ConditionalAccess-->>AzureAD: Block access (non-UK location)
        AzureAD-->>OutlookClient: 403 Forbidden (access restricted by location)
        OutlookClient-->>User: Contact IT to add to approved traveler list
        AzureAD->>AuditLog: Log blocked non-UK access attempt
    end

    ConditionalAccess->>ConditionalAccess: Policy 5: Check sign-in risk (Azure AD Identity Protection)

    alt High-risk sign-in (impossible travel, anonymous IP)
        ConditionalAccess-->>AzureAD: Require password change + re-auth

## Architecture Decisions

### Key Identity & Authentication Decisions

**Decision 1**: Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) over Federation (ADFS)
- **Context**: Cabinet Office requires hybrid identity during 6-month migration coexistence period (FR-002)
- **Decision**: Deploy Azure AD Connect with Password Hash Synchronization (PHS), NOT federation (ADFS)
- **Rationale**:
  - **Resilience**: Cloud authentication works even if on-prem AD offline (NFR-A-003 fault tolerance requirement)
  - **Simplicity**: No federation servers (ADFS) to manage, patch, monitor (reduces operational overhead)
  - **Zero Trust alignment**: Enables passwordless roadmap (FIDO2, Windows Hello) per Architecture Principle 11
  - **Microsoft recommendation**: PHS is Microsoft's recommended approach for hybrid identity (CSP resilience)
  - **Faster password sync**: Password changes sync within 2 minutes vs. real-time federation (acceptable trade-off)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Cloud authentication resilient to on-prem outages (9 instances of on-prem AD downtime in 2024)
  - ✅ No ADFS infrastructure (saves £50K capital, 0.5 FTE operational cost)
  - ✅ Enables Azure AD Identity Protection (risk-based Conditional Access) - not available with ADFS
  - ✅ Passwordless authentication roadmap feasible (FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business)
  - ⚠️ 30-minute sync delay for new users (acceptable: user provisioning SLA is 1 hour per TC-001)
  - ⚠️ Password changes sync within 2 minutes (acceptable: not real-time but meets user expectations)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)**: Real-time password validation but requires on-prem agent (single point of failure)
  - **Federation (ADFS)**: Real-time but complex, requires federation servers, downtime risk if ADFS offline
- **Validation**: NFR-A-003 (Fault Tolerance) validated - cloud auth works during on-prem AD outages

**Decision 2**: 100% MFA Enforcement (No Exceptions Except 2 Break-Glass Accounts)
- **Context**: NFR-SEC-001 mandates 100% MFA enforcement for NCSC Cloud Security Principle 9 compliance
- **Decision**: Conditional Access policy "Require MFA for All Users" with NO exceptions except 2 break-glass accounts
- **Rationale**:
  - **NCSC Principle 9**: Secure user management requires MFA for all access to OFFICIAL data
  - **Architecture Principle 11**: Zero Trust requires "verify explicitly" - passwords alone insufficient
  - **Threat landscape**: Credential stuffing, phishing, password spraying attacks are primary attack vectors
  - **Microsoft recommendation**: 99%+ reduction in account compromise with MFA enforcement
  - **Break-glass accounts**: 2 emergency accounts for Azure AD outage (stored in secure vault, audited quarterly)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ 99%+ reduction in credential compromise (Microsoft security research)
  - ✅ NCSC Cloud Security Principle 9 compliance (secure user management)
  - ✅ Zero Trust foundation ("verify explicitly" pillar)
  - ⚠️ 1-week MFA enrollment campaign required (3,500 users, 50 users/day enrollment rate)
  - ⚠️ User training required (Authenticator app installation, QR code scanning)
  - ⚠️ Support burden during enrollment (estimate 150 helpdesk tickets, 2 hours avg per ticket)
- **Break-Glass Account Governance**:
  - 2 accounts: `breakglass1@cabinetoffice.gov.uk`, `breakglass2@cabinetoffice.gov.uk`
  - Stored in secure physical vault (CTO office safe)
  - Excluded from Conditional Access policies (emergency access only)
  - Monitored: Alert on any sign-in (high-priority SOC alert)
  - Tested quarterly (simulated Azure AD outage scenario)
- **Validation**: NFR-SEC-001 (100% MFA) compliant

**Decision 3**: Device Compliance via Intune for Conditional Access
- **Context**: FR-004 mandates device compliance enforcement for Zero Trust access control
- **Decision**: Conditional Access policy "Require Compliant Device" with Intune compliance checks (encryption, firewall, antivirus, OS version, jailbreak detection)
- **Rationale**:
  - **Zero Trust pillar**: "Assume breach" - verify device health before granting access
  - **NCSC EUD Guidance**: Managed devices with encryption, antivirus, firewall mandatory for OFFICIAL data
  - **Architecture Principle 11**: Least privilege access - device compliance is prerequisite
  - **Intune integration**: Conditional Access queries Intune real-time (<1 second per INT-002 SLA)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Non-compliant devices (jailbroken, no encryption, outdated OS) blocked from email access
  - ✅ Mobile device security enforced (60% of users access email via mobile per BR-004)
  - ✅ Remote wipe capability for lost/stolen devices (GDPR data breach mitigation)
  - ⚠️ Intune enrollment required (2-week device enrollment campaign, 3,500 devices)
  - ⚠️ BYOD limited to Intune MAM (read-only email access, no file attachments download)
  - ⚠️ User resistance to device enrollment (privacy concerns, MDM profile visibility)
- **BYOD Policy**:
  - Personal devices (not owned by Cabinet Office): Intune MAM (Mobile Application Management) only
  - MAM policies: Read-only email access, copy/paste restricted, no "Save As" to personal cloud storage
  - Corporate devices (Cabinet Office-issued): Full Intune MDM enrollment required
- **Validation**: FR-004 (Conditional Access - Device Compliance) compliant, FR-010 (Intune MDM) compliant

**Decision 4**: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Admin Roles
- **Context**: NFR-SEC-002 mandates RBAC with least privilege and just-in-time (JIT) access for admin roles
- **Decision**: Deploy Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) with approval workflows for Global Admin and Exchange Admin roles
- **Rationale**:
  - **Least privilege**: Admins have NO standing admin privileges - activate only when needed (JIT)
  - **NCSC Cloud Security Principle 12**: Secure service administration requires time-limited privileged access
  - **Architecture Principle 11**: Zero Trust - "least privilege access" pillar
  - **Audit trail**: All PIM activations logged (who, what, when, why, approver) for 7-year retention
  - **Reduce attack surface**: 90% reduction in privileged account compromise (Microsoft security data)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ No standing admin privileges (zero persistent Global Admins)
  - ✅ 8-hour max activation reduces blast radius (compromised admin session limited to 8 hours)
  - ✅ Approval workflow for Global/Exchange Admin (separation of duties)
  - ✅ Audit trail for all privileged operations (NFR-C-002 7-year retention)
  - ⚠️ Admin workflow overhead (5-minute activation request, 10-minute approval SLA)
  - ⚠️ Break-glass accounts required for PIM/Azure AD outage (2 accounts, secure vault)
- **PIM Configuration**:
  - **Global Admin** (5 eligible, 0 active): Approval required, 8-hour max activation, MFA on activation
  - **Exchange Admin** (8 eligible, 0 active): Approval required, 8-hour max activation, justification required
  - **Security Admin** (5 eligible, 0 active): Self-activation (no approval), 4-hour max, MFA on activation
  - **Compliance Admin** (3 eligible, 0 active): Self-activation, 8-hour max
  - **Helpdesk** (10 eligible, 0 active): Self-activation, 8-hour max, limited permissions (password reset only)
- **Validation**: NFR-SEC-002 (RBAC with PIM) compliant, Architecture Principle 11 (Zero Trust) aligned

**Decision 5**: UK Geofencing with Approved Traveler Exception List
- **Context**: OFFICIAL data requires UK data residency and access control per Architecture Principle 1
- **Decision**: Conditional Access policy "Block Non-UK Locations" with approved traveler exception list
- **Rationale**:
  - **Data sovereignty**: OFFICIAL data should only be accessed from UK IPs (default posture)
  - **Threat mitigation**: 80% of nation-state attacks originate from non-UK IPs (NCSC threat intelligence)
  - **Insider threat**: Compromised credentials used from foreign IPs blocked automatically
  - **Traveler support**: Approved exception list for legitimate international travel (Ministers, senior officials)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ 80% reduction in foreign IP sign-in attempts (potential compromised credentials)
  - ✅ Data sovereignty enforcement (access from UK only by default)
  - ⚠️ Traveler exception process required (5-day approval SLA, manager approval workflow)
  - ⚠️ False positives (VPN, legitimate international travel) require exception process
  - ⚠️ User education required (notify IT 5 days before international travel)
- **Approved Traveler Process**:
  1. User submits traveler request (ServiceNow): Destination, dates, justification
  2. Manager approves (line manager sign-off required)
  3. IT Security reviews (5-day SLA)
  4. Approved: User added to "Approved Travelers" Azure AD group (Conditional Access exemption)
  5. Travel complete: User removed from group (automatic expiry based on travel end date)
- **Validation**: Architecture Principle 1 (UK Sovereignty) aligned, FR-004 (Conditional Access - Location) compliant

**Decision 6**: Sign-In Risk Policies (Azure AD Identity Protection)
- **Context**: FR-004 mandates risk-based Conditional Access policies for high-risk sign-ins
- **Decision**: Conditional Access policy "High-Risk Sign-In Controls" with Azure AD Identity Protection integration
- **Rationale**:
  - **Anomaly detection**: Machine learning detects impossible travel, anonymous IP, unfamiliar locations, malware-linked IPs
  - **Automated response**: High-risk sign-ins require password change + re-auth (without manual SOC intervention)
  - **Zero Trust**: "Assume breach" - even successful authentication may be compromised
  - **NCSC Cloud Security Principle 13**: Audit information for users - risk signals logged
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Automated remediation for high-risk sign-ins (compromised credentials neutralized immediately)
  - ✅ Reduces SOC burden (automated response vs. manual investigation)
  - ✅ Identity Protection signals improve over time (machine learning adapts to Cabinet Office patterns)
  - ⚠️ False positives (legitimate unusual sign-ins) require password change (user friction)
  - ⚠️ User education required (explain why password change required after international travel)
- **Risk Levels & Actions**:
  - **Low risk**: No action (allow access)
  - **Medium risk**: Require MFA (already enforced for all users, no additional action)
  - **High risk**: Require password change + MFA re-auth (automated remediation)
- **Validation**: FR-004 (Conditional Access - Risk Policies) compliant, NCSC Principle 13 aligned

## Wardley Map Integration

**Component Positioning**:

| Component | Visibility | Evolution | Stage | Strategic Action |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Azure AD (Entra ID) | 0.9 (Visible to IT/security) | 0.95 | Commodity | **USE** (commodity cloud identity, no competitive advantage from building) |
| Azure AD Connect (PHS) | 0.4 (Visible to IT) | 0.70 | Product | **USE** (transitional, roadmap to cloud-native identity within 24 months) |
| Conditional Access | 0.7 (Visible to security team) | 0.85 | Commodity | **USE** (standard Zero Trust access control, Microsoft-managed) |
| Intune (Device Compliance) | 0.7 (Visible to IT/users) | 0.73 | Product | **BUY** (MDM market maturing, Conditional Access integration critical) |
| MFA (Microsoft Authenticator, FIDO2) | 0.8 (Visible to all users) | 0.90 | Commodity | **USE** (commodity authentication method, FIDO2 open standard) |
| Privileged Identity Management (PIM) | 0.5 (Visible to IT security) | 0.75 | Product | **BUY** (just-in-time access market maturing, Azure AD native integration) |
| Azure AD Identity Protection (Sign-In Risk) | 0.6 (Visible to security team) | 0.70 | Product | **BUY** (machine learning threat detection, Microsoft proprietary but effective) |
| On-Premises Active Directory | 0.4 (Visible to IT) | 0.65 | Product (legacy) | **DECOMM** (roadmap to cloud-native identity, retire within 24 months post-migration) |

**Strategic Insights**:
- ✅ **Correct to USE Azure AD (Commodity 0.95)**: Identity platform is utility, no competitive advantage from building
- ✅ **Correct to USE Conditional Access (Commodity 0.85)**: Zero Trust access control is standard capability
- ✅ **Correct to BUY Intune, PIM, Identity Protection (Product 0.70-0.75)**: Mature product markets, Microsoft native integration
- ✅ **Azure AD Connect is transitional (Product 0.70)**: Hybrid identity bridge, roadmap to cloud-native (Azure AD-only) within 24 months
- ✅ **On-Premises AD is legacy (Product 0.65)**: Decommission roadmap aligns with cloud-first evolution

**Recommendation**: Create full Wardley Map (`/arckit.wardley`) showing identity components alongside M365 services for strategic roadmap planning.
