## Architecture Decisions

### Key Design Decisions

**Decision 1**: UK Data Residency (UK South Primary, UK West DR)
- **Context**: Cabinet Office handles OFFICIAL classified information requiring UK data sovereignty per Government Security Classifications Policy and Architecture Principle 1 (Cloud-First with UK Sovereignty)
- **Decision**: Configure M365 tenant for UK South (primary region), UK West (disaster recovery), Multi-Geo disabled
- **Rationale**:
  - Legal requirement: OFFICIAL data must remain in UK jurisdiction
  - TCoP Point 5 (Cloud First) compliance with UK residency constraint
  - Architecture Principle 1 mandates UK regions only (UK South/UK West)
  - NCSC Cloud Security Principle 2 (Asset Protection and Resilience) requires multi-region within UK
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Full compliance with data sovereignty requirements
  - ✅ Multi-region resilience within UK geographic boundaries
  - ✅ 99.9% SLA from Microsoft with UK failover
  - ⚠️ Slightly higher latency for international travel (mitigated by Outlook Anywhere cached mode)
  - ⚠️ No Multi-Geo capability (acceptable: no cross-border requirements)

**Decision 2**: Hybrid Identity with Azure AD Connect
- **Context**: Cabinet Office has 3,500 users in on-premises Active Directory requiring migration to cloud while maintaining SSO and password sync
- **Decision**: Deploy Azure AD Connect with Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) for hybrid identity
- **Rationale**:
  - PHS provides most resilient authentication method (cloud continues if on-prem fails)
  - Architecture Principle 11 (Zero Trust) requires cloud-native authentication
  - Enables Conditional Access policies based on Azure AD signals
  - SSO experience for users (no password changes during migration)
  - No federation infrastructure (simpler, more resilient than ADFS)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ High availability: Cloud authentication works even if on-prem AD offline
  - ✅ Simplified architecture: No ADFS or federation servers required
  - ✅ Enables passwordless authentication roadmap (FIDO2, Authenticator)
  - ⚠️ 30-minute sync delay for new user provisioning (acceptable per SLA)
  - ⚠️ Password changes sync within 2 minutes (meets user expectations)

**Decision 3**: Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2
- **Context**: Cabinet Office email is frequent target for phishing and nation-state attacks; Architecture Principle 3 (Security by Design) mandates advanced threat protection
- **Decision**: Deploy Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 with Safe Links, Safe Attachments, Anti-Impersonation, and Threat Investigation
- **Rationale**:
  - NCSC Cloud Security Principle 5 (Operational Security) requires proactive threat protection
  - NFR-SEC-005 mandates continuous vulnerability management
  - Protects against zero-day attacks, BEC (Business Email Compromise), whaling
  - Threat Explorer provides security analysts with investigation capabilities
  - Attack simulation training for user awareness (NFR-U-001)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ <5% reduction in successful phishing attacks (Cabinet Office target)
  - ✅ Real-time URL rewriting for Safe Links (click-time protection)
  - ✅ Sandbox detonation for attachments before delivery
  - ⚠️ Slight email delivery delay (<30 seconds 95th percentile, acceptable per NFR-P-001)
  - ⚠️ Additional licensing cost (already procured in M365 E5)

**Decision 4**: Sensitivity Labels (OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE)
- **Context**: Government Security Classifications Policy requires all Cabinet Office information to be classified; Architecture Principle 6 (Data Classification) mandates protective marking
- **Decision**: Deploy Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels with automatic labeling for OFFICIAL (default) and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE content
- **Rationale**:
  - Legal requirement: Government Security Classifications Policy
  - FR-005 mandates sensitivity labels with visual markings and encryption
  - DLP policies prevent unauthorized sharing of OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE externally
  - Labels embedded in metadata (persistent protection even if file exported)
  - Auto-classification based on keywords (e.g., "Cabinet Paper", "OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE")
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ 100% compliance with Government Security Classifications Policy
  - ✅ DLP blocks external sharing of OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE (zero data leakage target)
  - ✅ Audit trail for all label application (NFR-C-002)
  - ⚠️ User training required (label selection, classification guidance)
  - ⚠️ False positives on auto-classification (<5% target, user can override with justification)

**Decision 5**: Conditional Access Zero Trust Policies
- **Context**: Architecture Principle 11 (Zero Trust) requires explicit verification for every access request; remote access and mobile devices increase attack surface
- **Decision**: Deploy 5 Conditional Access policies (MFA mandatory, block legacy auth, require compliant device, UK geofencing, high-risk controls)
- **Rationale**:
  - NFR-SEC-001 mandates 100% MFA enforcement (no exceptions except 2 break-glass accounts)
  - Zero Trust principle: Verify explicitly, least privilege, assume breach
  - Device compliance via Intune prevents jailbroken/compromised devices
  - Geofencing blocks non-UK access (with approved traveler exception list)
  - Legacy authentication (POP3/IMAP basic auth) is vulnerable, must be blocked
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ 100% MFA coverage (NCSC Cloud Security Principle 9)
  - ✅ Legacy auth blocked (90% reduction in credential stuffing attacks)
  - ✅ Non-compliant devices blocked (prevents BYOD without Intune enrollment)
  - ⚠️ User enrollment in MFA required (1-week enrollment campaign)
  - ⚠️ Travel exceptions require 5-day approval process (acceptable)

**Decision 6**: 7-Year Audit Log Retention
- **Context**: Government Security Classifications Policy requires 7-year audit retention for OFFICIAL records; Public Records Act requires evidence for FOI requests
- **Decision**: Enable Unified Audit Log with 7-year retention (10-year for admin activities) and real-time streaming to Microsoft Sentinel SIEM
- **Rationale**:
  - NFR-C-002 mandates 7-year audit retention for OFFICIAL compliance
  - FR-011 requires audit logs for all privileged operations
  - Architecture Principle 19 (Audit Logging) mandates immutable logging
  - SIEM integration enables real-time threat detection and incident response
  - FOI requests require historical email search capability (FR-009)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Full compliance with Government Security Classifications Policy
  - ✅ Real-time security monitoring (<5 min event ingestion to Sentinel per INT-003)
  - ✅ 7-year searchable history for FOI, eDiscovery, investigations
  - ⚠️ Additional M365 E5 licensing required (already procured)
  - ⚠️ Azure storage costs for long-term audit log retention (£15K/year, budgeted)

**Decision 7**: Phased Migration with Pilot (Finance Directorate)
- **Context**: BR-005 requires phased migration timeline; risk of large-scale migration failure requires validation approach
- **Decision**: Pilot migration (Month 3, 100 users in Finance directorate) followed by 3 phased migrations (Months 5-9, 1,200/1,200/1,000 users)
- **Rationale**:
  - Pilot validates migration process, tooling, and rollback procedures
  - Finance directorate integrates with financial systems (validates third-party SMTP relay)
  - Lessons learned from pilot inform Phase 1-3 migrations
  - Phased approach minimizes business impact (not all directorates affected simultaneously)
  - Weekend cutover windows minimize downtime (NFR-A-001 99.9% availability)
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Pilot reduces risk of large-scale failure (validate before scaling)
  - ✅ Finance validation covers financial system integrations (critical path)
  - ✅ 6-month hybrid coexistence provides rollback window
  - ⚠️ 6-month hybrid overhead (on-prem Exchange must remain operational)
  - ⚠️ User confusion during hybrid (some users on-prem, some cloud)

## UK Government Compliance

### Technology Code of Practice

| TCoP Point | Compliance | Component(s) | Evidence |
|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **1. Define user needs** | ✅ Compliant | Requirements (BR-001 to BR-007, FR-001 to FR-015), user research with Cabinet Office directorates | Requirements document (projects/001-exchange-online-migration/requirements.md) with user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics |
| **2. Make things accessible and inclusive** | ✅ Compliant | Outlook Web App (WCAG 2.2 AA), training materials, accessibility statement | NFR-U-002 mandates WCAG 2.2 AA. OWA screen reader compatible (JAWS, NVDA). Accessibility testing with Pa11y, Axe. User testing with disabled users. |
| **3. Be open and use open source** | ⚠️ Partial (M365 proprietary, but supports open standards) | Exchange Online (SMTP, IMAP), Azure AD (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML 2.0) | NFR-I-001 mandates open standards (SMTP, OAuth 2.0). M365 is proprietary SaaS but supports standards-based protocols. |
| **4. Make use of open standards** | ✅ Compliant | Exchange Online (SMTP, iCalendar, vCard), Azure AD (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML 2.0), Microsoft Graph (OpenAPI) | Architecture Principle 5 (Open Standards). SMTP for email, OAuth 2.0 for auth, iCalendar for calendar, vCard for contacts. Data export to open formats (PST, EML). |
| **5. Use cloud first** | ✅ Compliant | All M365 services (Exchange Online, Azure AD, Defender, Purview, Intune) hosted in UK Azure regions | BR-001 mandates cloud-first. Architecture Principle 1 (Cloud-First with UK Sovereignty). UK South + UK West regions. Multi-Geo disabled (UK only). |
| **6. Make things secure** | ✅ Compliant | MFA (100%), Conditional Access, Defender, DLP, sensitivity labels, audit logging, PIM, encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256) | Architecture Principle 3 (Security by Design). NCSC Cloud Security Principles compliance. NFR-SEC-001 to NFR-SEC-005. SIRO sign-off. CHECK assessment. |
| **7. Make privacy integral** | ✅ Compliant | PIA approved by DPO, UK GDPR compliance, SAR procedures (eDiscovery), sensitivity labels, DLP | Architecture Principle 8 (Privacy by Design). NFR-C-001 (UK GDPR). PIA completed. DPO consulted. SAR <20 days via eDiscovery. |
| **8. Share, reuse and collaborate** | ⚠️ Partial (M365 SaaS, not open source; cross-gov collaboration enabled) | Exchange Online (SMTP to *.gov.uk), Azure AD B2B guest access, Teams federation | NFR-I-002 (Cross-Government Integration). SMTP with TLS to *.gov.uk. Exchange Federation for free/busy. Azure AD B2B for external collaboration. |
| **9. Integrate and adapt technology** | ✅ Compliant | Azure AD Connect (hybrid identity), Graph API for integrations, Power Automate for workflows | Architecture Principle 9 (Approved Tech Stack). Hybrid coexistence with on-prem AD/Exchange. Graph API for third-party integrations. |
| **10. Make better use of data** | ✅ Compliant | Purview data governance, retention labels, eDiscovery, Unified Audit Log, analytics (Power BI dashboards) | Architecture Principle 7 (Data Quality and Lifecycle). Retention labels, eDiscovery for data insights, audit logs for compliance analytics. |

**Overall TCoP Compliance**: 8/10 full compliance, 2/10 partial (TCoP 3 and 8 due to M365 being proprietary SaaS, but open standards supported)

### GOV.UK Services

| GOV.UK Service | Used | Component | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **GOV.UK Pay** | ❌ No | N/A | Not applicable: Exchange Online migration does not involve payment processing |
| **GOV.UK Notify** | ⚠️ Recommended (not in initial scope) | Notification service for migration communications | Could be used for migration notifications (pilot invites, cutover notifications). Out of scope for Phase 1, consider for user communications. |
| **GOV.UK Design System** | ❌ No | N/A | Not applicable: OWA uses Microsoft Fluent Design (not customizable). Internal tools could use GDS for consistency. |
| **GOV.UK Verify** | ❌ No | N/A | Not applicable: Cabinet Office uses on-prem AD synced to Azure AD (not public-facing authentication) |
| **GOV.UK PaaS** | ❌ No | N/A | Not applicable: M365 is SaaS, not PaaS. No custom app hosting required. |

**Recommendation**: Consider GOV.UK Notify for migration communications (pilot invites, cutover schedules, training reminders) to demonstrate Share & Reuse (TCoP Point 8). Estimated cost: £500 for 50,000 notifications.

### AI Playbook Compliance (for AI systems)

**AI Risk Level**: N/A (Exchange Online migration does not involve AI/ML systems)

**Note**: Microsoft Defender for Office 365 uses machine learning for threat detection, but this is embedded in the Microsoft service (not a Cabinet Office-developed AI system). Microsoft is responsible for AI governance and bias testing for Defender ML models.

If future M365 workloads involve AI (e.g., Copilot for M365):
- **ATRS Required**: Yes (Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard)
- **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop for high-risk decisions
- **Bias Testing**: Required for AI models affecting citizens
- **Explainability**: Required for automated decision-making

**Related Wardley Map**: Not yet created. Recommended to run `/arckit.wardley` to generate Wardley Map showing build vs buy decisions for M365 components.

### Component Positioning (Estimated)

| Component | Visibility | Evolution | Stage | Strategic Action |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Exchange Online | 1.0 (Visible to all users) | 0.92 | Commodity | **USE** (commodity email service, no competitive advantage from building) |
| Azure AD (Entra ID) | 0.9 (Visible to IT/security) | 0.95 | Commodity | **USE** (commodity identity platform, standard for cloud-first) |
| Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | 0.7 (Visible to security team) | 0.75 | Product | **BUY** (mature product market, feature differentiation among vendors) |
| Microsoft Purview | 0.6 (Visible to compliance team) | 0.72 | Product | **BUY** (emerging governance market, Microsoft integration advantage) |
| Microsoft Intune | 0.7 (Visible to IT/end users) | 0.73 | Product | **BUY** (MDM market maturing, Conditional Access integration critical) |
| Sensitivity Labels (OFFICIAL/OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE) | 0.5 (Visible to compliance) | 0.45 | Custom | **BUILD** (custom to UK Gov Security Classifications Policy, competitive advantage from proper classification) |
| Retention Labels (Public Records Act) | 0.5 (Visible to compliance) | 0.48 | Custom | **BUILD** (custom to Cabinet Office retention schedules, National Archives integration) |
| Azure AD Connect (Hybrid Identity) | 0.4 (Visible to IT) | 0.70 | Product | **USE** (transitional component, decommission when on-prem AD retired) |
| On-Premises Exchange 2016 | 0.9 (Visible to users) | 0.60 | Product (legacy) | **DECOMM** (legacy system, end-of-support, migrate to cloud) |
| On-Premises Active Directory | 0.4 (Visible to IT) | 0.65 | Product (legacy) | **EXISTING** (hybrid coexistence, future roadmap to Azure AD-only) |

### Strategic Alignment

**Strategic Insights**:

✅ **Correct Strategic Decisions**:
1. **USE Exchange Online** (Commodity 0.92): Email is undifferentiated capability. No competitive advantage from building or self-hosting. Cloud-first mandate aligns with commodity evolution.
2. **USE Azure AD** (Commodity 0.95): Identity platform is utility. Zero Trust requires cloud-native identity. Correct to USE, not BUILD.
3. **BUY Defender, Purview, Intune** (Product 0.70-0.75): Mature product markets with feature differentiation. Microsoft E5 licensing includes these. Correct to BUY (via M365 E5 subscription).
4. **BUILD Sensitivity Labels for OFFICIAL/OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE** (Custom 0.45): UK Government Security Classifications are unique requirement. Competitive advantage from proper classification (data protection). Correct to BUILD custom labels using Purview platform.
5. **DECOMM On-Premises Exchange** (Product 0.60, legacy): End-of-support, moving to cloud. Correct to decommission.

⚠️ **Future Considerations**:
1. **Azure AD Connect is transitional** (Product 0.70): Hybrid identity is temporary bridge. Roadmap should move to Azure AD-only (cloud-native identity) within 24 months. Consider cloud-only for new joiners.
2. **On-Premises AD is legacy** (Product 0.65): Long-term strategy should retire on-prem AD in favor of Azure AD + Intune + Windows Autopilot (cloud-native device provisioning).

**Strategic Alignment Validation**:
- ✅ All BUILD decisions align with Custom stage (sensitivity labels, retention labels custom to UK Gov)
- ✅ All BUY decisions align with Product stage (Defender, Purview, Intune have mature product markets)
- ✅ All USE decisions align with Commodity stage (Exchange Online, Azure AD are utilities)
- ✅ No commodity components being built (correct)
- ✅ No Genesis components being bought (correct)
- ✅ Legacy components flagged for decommissioning (on-prem Exchange) or eventual retirement (on-prem AD, Azure AD Connect)

**Recommendation**: Create Wardley Map (`/arckit.wardley`) to visualize evolution stages and validate build vs buy decisions. Include in architecture review (Gate 3).
