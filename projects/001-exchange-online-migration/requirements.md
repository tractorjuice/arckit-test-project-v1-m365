**Document Type**: Business and Technical Requirements

## Executive Summary

### Business Context

The Cabinet Office currently operates an on-premises Exchange Server infrastructure that has reached end-of-support lifecycle and requires significant capital investment for hardware refresh. This legacy infrastructure poses operational, security, and cost risks while limiting the organization's ability to support flexible working arrangements essential for modern government operations.

This project will migrate all Cabinet Office email, calendaring, and collaboration services from on-premises Exchange Server to Microsoft Exchange Online within the M365 cloud platform. The migration aligns with UK Government Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) Point 3 (Use cloud first) and Cabinet Office's strategic objective to modernize IT infrastructure while reducing total cost of ownership.

The migration will affect approximately 3,500 Cabinet Office users across multiple directorates and will be executed in a phased approach to minimize business disruption while ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance with Government Security Classifications Policy.

### Objectives

- **Migrate 100% of Cabinet Office email to Exchange Online** within 9 months, decommissioning on-premises Exchange infrastructure
- **Ensure UK data sovereignty** with all mailbox data stored exclusively in Azure UK regions (UK South primary, UK West disaster recovery)
- **Maintain zero data loss** during migration with comprehensive validation and rollback procedures
- **Achieve 99.9% service availability** post-migration aligned with Microsoft M365 SLA
- **Enable secure mobile access** to email via Intune-managed devices with Conditional Access policies
- **Reduce total cost of ownership by 40%** through elimination of on-premises hardware, software licenses, and datacenter costs
- **Comply with all Cabinet Office architecture principles** including security by design, accessibility, and information governance

### Expected Outcomes

- **Cost savings of £800K annually** through elimination of Exchange server licenses, hardware maintenance, and datacenter hosting costs
- **Improved user productivity** with mobile access to email, modern Outlook features, and 100GB mailbox quotas (increased from current 2GB)
- **Enhanced security posture** with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (Plan 2), anti-phishing, anti-malware, and zero-day threat protection
- **Reduced IT operational burden** by 60% through migration to Microsoft-managed infrastructure with automatic patching and updates
- **Full compliance** with OFFICIAL data classification, UK GDPR, Public Records Act, and NCSC Cloud Security Principles
- **Improved business continuity** with Microsoft's 99.9% SLA, geo-redundant UK regions, and elimination of single-datacenter risk
